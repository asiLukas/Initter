# Small social app made with Python, Django

### This project is in early development and isn't meant for production.
If you want to run this project you need to have Python 3 and installed requirements

` pip install -r requirements.txt `

You also need to generate new key for line `24` in `settings.py`, because I might make this site live and don't want anyone to have that key.

Then just  `python manage.py runserver` and you should be good to go.

There also is superuser with name: `admin` and password: `admin`, feel free to use it.

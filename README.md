# Small social app made with Python, Django

If you want to run this project you need to have Python 3 and installed requirements

` pip install -r requirements.txt `

Then just  `python manage.py runserver` and you should be good to go.

There also is superuser with name: `admin` and password: `admin`, feel free to use it.

I'm starting to learn Javascript, after I will learn it a bit, I will probably update Initter with some kind of chat
